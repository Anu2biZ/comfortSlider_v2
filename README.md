<h4> Important bug fixes in v2</h4> 
                   <p>No matter what <code>height</code> have your pictures. Now they display stable.</p>
                   <p>Photos wrap by <code>.grow</code> block. They amount depends on configure (lg : 5 - 5 photos in block)</p>
                   <p>If xs=1, indents are the same (in first version, they were defferent)</p>
                   <p>Opening modal by clicking the photo on smartphones/tablets is larger</p>
                   <p>You don't need to connect <code>font-awesome</code>. Plug-in will do it by itself</p>
